== Flashing via OpenWrt ==
This subtree includes two files, intended to ease flashing hex files to the LPC17xx chip.

* bootloader.py; Which resets the LPC into serial bootloader mode
* flash.sh; Which invokes the bootloader.py before running the lpc21isp tool.

Using these tools assume 'sh', 'python' ('mraa' and the standard library) and the lpc21isp is installed.

== Usage ==
Place the LPC hex-file (named main-combined.hex) along-side the flash.sh script, and run:
```
./flash.sh [FILENAME]
```

Segmentation Faults or Illegal Instruction errors may occur, at which point the script retries.
